move command to properties: commands can be personal, so create a new file local.properties which be vcs ignored
Move the string command into that file

Create local.properties file
 Read from local.properites when creating merge config





remove numbers
Run out of schema task
run tenant_properties_views
keynames are always load from ad
-d or -v to show _db.fetch.queries
x print version
do not add select stmts to tableData.sql


Generator 
with_connnection_details
   Remove database_type is not part of the connection details

Multiple tests per one template, e.g. add_dynamic_entity_field can add string or tagset
	



#####

1. return path on get_logger_config (instead of string) and chec path.exists on cliente method
2. Search on google "composition root runtime parameters", how do you handle passing a parameter that is computed a runtime and it is required by the method. SQLScriptedFolder.write - you will pass it on the method parameters but because write is implementing a framework
