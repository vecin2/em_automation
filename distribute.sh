#The pip download command lets you download packages without installing them:
#
#pip download -r requirements.txt
#
#(In previous versions of pip, this was spelled pip install --download -r requirements.txt.)
#
#Then you can use pip install --no-index --find-links /path/to/download/dir/ -r requirements.txt to install those downloaded sdists, without accessing the network.
