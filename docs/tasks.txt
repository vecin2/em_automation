----basic distribution 
+Print output to a a file
+ fix work around of running set_env_vars.sh to make test pass
+ tidy up imports
+ remove em_dev_tools from classpath
+template with default prompt
  +install version
+template with description prompt
+tempalte with both
tempalte with include
+parse an included template which top node is not output
+when same variable appear multiple times use first appereance
strip to strip code lines (template design doc)
set as default a variable (p3 highly complex not much funcionality)
interaces - code structure, do you keep them together
refactoring:
  use templates instead of template_names, as it allows to take advantage of on the fly created templates
  Use relative path when creating environment (util_test_template_env.py)
  review loop counter (assert_equals_prompt_text_list test_prompter)
  fix nerdtree

release v1.0
	- prompts all variables within template
	- Filters: default and description
	- include templates
	- create db module with manual svn rev number

  +clean code
  +release one version
  ***document install
  test version
	rewire_verb
	add sql templates

errors:
	- when passing module starting with / it tries to create it in top folder and fails becouse not permission. It should not let you go through all the flow and fail at the end. It should check before if it has permissions.

other features:
	- dynamic/decision based prompts
	- Filters: db filters
	- Code refactorings:
		- refactor to model/view/controller design (do not prompt on the model)
		- logging
